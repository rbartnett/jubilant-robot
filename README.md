# jubilant-robot


jubilant-robot was the suggested name for this repository. Behold my completion of the github repository and branch tutorial. Behold.

The tutorial told me to write about myself here. Behold this brief description about me. 

I am interested in Python, SQL, and R for future career aspirations. Potentially tableau and alteryx as well.
