jubilant-robot was the suggested name for this repository. Behold my completion of the github repository and branch tutorial. Behold.

The tutorial told me to write about myself here. Behold this brief description about me. 

I am interested in Python, SQL, and R for future career aspirations. Potentially tableau and alteryx as well.

11.26.2023 RB - Making progress on my programming knowledge. Well into the territory of "skilled enough to build things and tired of doing random code snippets". I am now proficient in C, SQL (MySQL, T-SQL), and VBA (becuase of my job).
